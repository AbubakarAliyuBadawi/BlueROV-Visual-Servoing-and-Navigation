# BlueROV Visual Servoing and Autonomous Navigation

This repository hosts the development and integration of advanced visual servoing and autonomous navigation capabilities into the BlueROV. This project aims to enhance the operational efficiency and autonomy of underwater remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) through sophisticated control systems and real-time environmental interaction.

## Project Overview

The BlueROV Visual Servoing and Autonomous Navigation project combines cutting-edge computer vision and control algorithms to enable the BlueROV to perform complex tasks autonomously in challenging underwater environments. By leveraging high-resolution cameras and sonar data, the BlueROV can navigate obstacles, follow predetermined paths, and interact with its surroundings with high precision.

## Features

- **Visual Servoing**: Utilize high-resolution camera feedback to adjust the ROV's position and orientation in real-time, ensuring precise alignment and movement towards target objects or waypoints.
- **Autonomous Navigation**: Implement sonar-based navigation systems that allow the ROV to detect and avoid obstacles autonomously, facilitating safe traversal through cluttered underwater environments.
- **Control Algorithms**: Advanced PID control mechanisms and state estimation filters are used to manage the vehicle's dynamics and ensure stable operation under varying conditions.
- **Simulation and Testing**: Includes simulation environments for testing and validating control strategies before deployment in real-world scenarios.
